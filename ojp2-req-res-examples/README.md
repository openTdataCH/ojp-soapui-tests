# Request / Response validation for the Swiss OJP 2.0 service
Matthias GÃ¼nter 2024, contact opendata@sbb.ch

There are three pyhton scripts in here:
* extract_reqs.py - extracts the requests for OJP 2.0 from the ../SwissOJP2.0 soapui file and stores them in the examples folder 
* config.py - containing the configuration for extract_reqs
* actualize_req_res_ojp2.0.py - downloads the current XSD directly from the OJP repository and then starts validating and processing them

## What is checked
* The requests are checked against OJP XSD 2.0.
* The requests are transfered to the OJP 2.0 server from Switzerland.
* The responses are validated.

If there is a problem with a request, then a  *.err.req.txt file is stored with the problem
If there is a problem with a response, then a *.err.response.txt file is stored with the problem.

If request and response are present, then they are both valid and the response was provided by the server.

## Important note
Be aware that the OJP 2.0 is under active and rapid development.
