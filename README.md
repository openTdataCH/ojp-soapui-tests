# ojp-soapui-tests
This is a repo for different OJP Tests

# How to sort
Add for each kind of system a folder and structure which match the OJP Router Structure with its subsystems. E.g. for the LinkingAlps project and its use cases for passive systems make sub folders like: "LinkingAlps/SBB passive server" or "LinkingApls/STA active server".

# Adding test cases
Make meaningful names for the folder containing the testcase

# Remarks
The term active system is a server which integrates several passive system, which is referenced in the OJP specification as a distributed OJP router.
