This is a repo contains different tests for OJP instances in Europe. The main focus is the Swiss servers  (see https://opentransportdata.swiss)


# OJP 2.0 SOAPUI
We have tests for SOAPUI: https://github.com/openTdataCH/ojp-soapui-tests/tree/main/Swiss-OJP-2.0
You need to add the necessary information directly to the global properties of your SOAPUI.

# LinkingAlps SOAPUI
## How to sort
Add for each kind of system a folder and structure which match the OJP Router Structure with its subsystems. E.g. for the LinkingAlps project and its use cases for passive systems make sub folders like: "LinkingAlps/SBB passive server" or "LinkingApls/STA active server".

## Adding test cases
Make meaningful names for the file containing the testcase

## Remarks
The term active system is a server which integrates several passive system, which is referenced in the OJP specification as a distributed OJP router.
We have test cases for OJP 2.0.
